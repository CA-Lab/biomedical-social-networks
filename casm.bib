    abstract = {Background Significant efforts are underway within the biomedical research community to encourage sharing and reuse of research data in order to enhance research reproducibility and enable scientific discovery. While some technological challenges do exist, many of the barriers to sharing and reuse are social in nature, arising from researchers’ concerns about and attitudes toward sharing their data. In addition, clinical and basic science researchers face their own unique sets of challenges to sharing data within their communities. This study investigates these differences in experiences with and perceptions about sharing data, as well as barriers to sharing among clinical and basic science researchers.   Methods Clinical and basic science researchers in the Intramural Research Program at the National Institutes of Health were surveyed about their attitudes toward and experiences with sharing and reusing research data. Of 190 respondents to the survey, the 135 respondents who identified themselves as clinical or basic science researchers were included in this analysis. Odds ratio and Fisher’s exact tests were the primary methods to examine potential relationships between variables. Worst-case scenario sensitivity tests were conducted when necessary.   Results and Discussion While most respondents considered data sharing and reuse important to their work, they generally rated their expertise as low. Sharing data directly with other researchers was common, but most respondents did not have experience with uploading data to a repository. A number of significant differences exist between the attitudes and practices of clinical and basic science researchers, including their motivations for sharing, their reasons for not sharing, and the amount of work required to prepare their data.   Conclusions Even within the scope of biomedical research, addressing the unique concerns of diverse research communities is important to encouraging researchers to share and reuse data. Efforts at promoting data sharing and reuse should be aimed at solving not only technological problems, but also addressing researchers’ concerns about sharing their data. Given the varied practices of individual researchers and research communities, standardizing data practices like data citation and repository upload could make sharing and reuse easier.},

title="Growth of international collaboration in science: revisiting six specialties",
journal="Scientometrics",
year="2017",
volume="110",
number="3",
pages="1633--1652",
abstract="International collaboration in science continues to grow at a remarkable rate, but little agreement exists about dynamics of growth and organization at the discipline level. Some suggest that disciplines differ in their collaborative tendencies, reflecting their epistemic culture. This study examines collaborative patterns in six previously studied specialties to add new data and analyze patterns over time. Our findings show that a global network of collaboration continues to add new nations and new participants; since 1990, each specialty has added many new nations to lists of collaborating partners. We also find that the scope of international collaboration is positively related to impact. Network characteristics for the six specialties are notable in that instead of reflecting underlying culture, they tend towards convergence at the global level. This observation suggests that the global level may represent next-order dynamics that feed back to the national and local levels (as subsystems) in a complex, networked hierarchy.",

Separately, a co-occurrence method is used to represent the subject structure (the main topics and their links) of his papers in physics. The principle underlying this method is to develop a network based on common appearances of classification subdivisions (headings) as well as of controlled terms in Moravcsik's document records. The results, in the form of line and point graphs, give a global picture of Mike Moravcsik's research profile in physics.",

    %abstract = { Biobank-based research in Mexico is mostly governed by research and data protection laws. There is no direct mention of biobanks in either statutory or regulatory law besides a requirement that the Federal Ministry of Health and a Mexican institution devoted to scientific research approve the transfer of biological materials outside of Mexico for population genetics research purposes. Such requirements are the basis of Genomic Sovereignty in Mexico, but such requirements have not prevented international collaboration. In addition, Mexican law singles out genetic research in informed consent provisions, but it does not specify whether all biobank-based research is genetic research. In order to facilitate international collaboration on biobank-based research, Mexico should directly address biobanking in its laws, building on the research framework and data protection framework already in place. }

Abstract = {{Recently, the authors proposed a quantum prisoner's dilemma game based
   on the spatial game of Nowak and May, and showed that the game can be
   played classically. By using this idea, we proposed three generalized
   prisoner's dilemma (GPD, for short) games based on the weak Prisoner's
   dilemma game, the full prisoner's dilemma game and the normalized
   Prisoner's dilemma game, written by GPD(W), GPD(F) and GPD(N)
   respectively. Our games consist of two players, each of which has three
   strategies: cooperator (C), defector (D) and super cooperator (denoted
   by Q), and have a parameter. to measure the entangled relationship
   between the two players. We found that our generalised prisoner's
   dilemma games have new Nash equilibrium principles, that entanglement is
   the principle of emergence and convergence (i.e., guaranteed emergence)
   of super cooperation in evolutions of our generalised prisoner's dilemma
   games on scale-free networks, that entanglement provides a threshold for
   a phase transition of super cooperation in evolutions of our generalised
   prisoner's dilemma games on scale-free networks, that the role of
   heterogeneity of the scale-free networks in cooperations and super
   cooperations is very limited, and that well-defined structures of
   scale-free networks allow coexistence of cooperators and super
   cooperators in the evolutions of the weak version of our generalised
   prisoner's dilemma games.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the robustness of cooperation on scale-free (SF)
   networks in the prisoner's dilemma game under different attack
   strategies. Although previous works have demonstrated that increasing
   heterogeneity constitutes higher levels of cooperation, we elaborated on
   this subject further by introducing a parameter alpha to take into
   consideration two significant aspects during an attack. We have shown
   that it is possible to precisely control the cooperation level on SF
   networks to be robust (alpha << 0) or fragile (alpha >= 0). Moreover, we
   studied the evolution on SF networks against a different attack
   strategy, taking over the nodes instead of simply removing the nodes, to
   address the functional importance of a node. Notably, the network
   structure remains the same during the evolutionary process under this
   attack strategy, which allows us to investigate the correlation between
   the functional significance and survival of cooperation. Our results
   highlight the underlying mechanism of cooperation behavior on SF
   networks and have several important implications for public health and
   networks security. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2014}},

Abstract = {{We study an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game on a scale-free network

   finding is that the cooperation level can be significantly improved when

   is also introduced to control the diversity level of inertia among the
   individuals. It is found that there exists an optimal value of beta
   leading to the highest cooperation level. The observed results are
   explained by the feedback mechanism and the characteristic of the Fermi

Abstract = {{The evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game is investigated under different

   one hand, cooperation can be enhanced with the increasing clustering

   cooperators initially. On the other hand, if cooperators just occupy the
   lowest-degree nodes at the beginning, then the higher the value of the
   clustering coefficient, the more unfavorable the environment for
   cooperators to survive for the increment of temptation to defect.
   Thereafter, we analytically argue these nontrivial phenomena by
   calculating the cooperation probability of the nodes with different
   degrees in the steady state, and obtain the critical values of initial
   frequency of cooperators below which cooperators would vanish finally

   spreading, the evolution of cooperation is inhibited on the structured
   scale-free network when the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game is modeled.
   First, we demonstrate that neither the scale-free property nor the high
   clustering coefficient is responsible for the inhibition of cooperation
   spreading on the structured scale-free network. Then we provide one
   heuristic method to argue that the lack of age correlations and its
   associated `large-world' behavior in the structured scale-free network
   inhibit the spread of cooperation. These findings may help enlighten
   further studies on the evolutionary dynamics of the PD game in

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma on weighted
   scale-free networks. The weighted networks are generated by adopting
   Barabasi-Albert scale-free network and assigning link weight with w(ij)
   = (k(i) x k(j))(beta). Simulation results show that the cooperation
   frequency has a strong dependence on beta. The value of,8 which is
   associated with the maximal cooperation frequency has been sought out.
   Moreover, Gini coefficient and Pareto exponent of the system's wealth
   distribution are investigated. The inequality of wealth distribution is
   minimized at beta approximate to -1. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the transition towards effective payoffs in the prisoner's
   dilemma game on scale-free networks by introducing a normalization
   parameter guiding the system from accumulated payoffs to payoffs
   normalized with the connectivity of each agent. We show that during this
   transition the heterogeneity-based ability of scale-free networks to
   facilitate cooperative behavior deteriorates continuously, eventually
   collapsing with the results obtained on regular graphs. The strategy
   donations and adaptation probabilities of agents with different
   connectivities are studied. Results reveal that strategies generally
   spread from agents with larger towards agents with smaller degree.
   However, this strategy adoption flow reverses sharply in the fully
   normalized payoff limit. Surprisingly, cooperators occupy the hubs even
   if the averaged cooperation level due to partly normalized payoffs is
   moderate. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
